"""SigV4 request signer for the Bedrock **runtime** OpenAI wires (httpx, not boto3).

Why this exists at all: ``bedrock-runtime`` serves the OpenAI dialect at
``/openai/v1/responses`` and ``/openai/v1/chat/completions`` as plain HTTPS — those paths
are NOT botocore operations, so boto3 cannot call them and the request must be signed by
hand (verified live 2026-09-03: SigV4 service name ``bedrock``, both paths return 200 and
a real SSE stream). Everything else on the Bedrock runtime plane (InvokeModel/Converse)
keeps using ``providers/bedrock_adapter.py`` + boto3.

Two credential paths, mirroring :class:`~app.services.mantle_credentials.MantleCredentialBroker`:

* in-account (``role_arn`` is None) — the pod's own IRSA credentials.
* cross-account (``role_arn`` set) — STS AssumeRole, creds cached ~1h.

It vends SIGNATURES where the Mantle broker vends BEARER TOKENS; the duplication of the
assume+cache block is deliberate. Folding both into one broker would mean editing the
live Cowork/Codex bearer path to add a runtime-plane feature, and a regression there takes
down two shipped clients. The two caches are also keyed differently: a bearer is bound to
(creds, region) and reusable for 30 min, while a signature is per-request (it covers the
body hash) so only the CREDENTIALS are worth caching here.
